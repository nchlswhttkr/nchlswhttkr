<h2 align="center">G'day, I'm Nicholas! :wave:</h2>

I'm a developer with a love for web development and automation.

At the moment, I'm helping organise logistics with the awesome crew at [UNIHACK](https://unihack.net).

You can read posts about my interests on [my blog](https://nicholas.cloud/) or via [my RSS feed](https://nicholas.cloud/rss/). I tend to write about music, weekend projects and short technical dives into the software I use.

When I'm not coding, I'm likely playing brass/piano or at band rehearsal! :musical_note: :musical_note: :musical_note:
