<h2 align="center">G'day, I'm Nicholas! :wave:</h2>

I'm a developer with a love for web development and automation.

At the moment, I'm helping organise logistics with the awesome crew at [UNIHACK](https://unihack.net).

I believe in **learning in public**. I always endeavour to put my work on GitHub and to write about it on [my blog](https://nicholas.cloud/blog/) ([RSS](https://nicholas.cloud/rss/)), so I can share what I'm learning with those around me.

When I'm not coding up a storm, you're likely to find me practising trombone, euphonium or piano! :musical_note: :musical_note: :musical_note:
